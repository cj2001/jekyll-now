It has now been about 4 months since I quit my job as a tenure track professor at an R1 university to take a position as a data scientist in Silicon Valley.  I would be lying if I said the transition has been 100% smooth.  But even so, I am still deliriously happy that I managed to get out!  Despite the complete shock of many of my colleagues that I gave up the "dream job for life" (see some of my previous posts), I have also had several colleagues, primarily some of the my more junior friends, tell me that they are contemplating the same move but do not know how to start.  So I figured that was worth at least a blog post or two.

First things first...my experiences are just my experiences.  YMMV on anything I post here.  Second, I can only write this from my perspective, which is that of someone with a PhD in nuclear engineering from the number 1 ranked graduate school in the field.  After getting my PhD, I went to work in the national lab system for a while and then in the federal government in reearch positions.  I returned to academia after spending 10 years outside it and then spent 5 years on the tenure track.
