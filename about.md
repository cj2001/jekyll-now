CJ worked for 10 years as a scientist within various parts of the federal government before returning to academia. This makes her pursuit of tenure atypical to begin with in that most people go from PhD to postdoc to tenure track.  She has been on the tenure track since Fall, 2012 and, in theory, should get tenure awarded beginning Fall, 2018.  This blog, started in June, 2017, will document the journey of the next year.

As a note, CJ could have chosen to write this blog anonymously, but didn't because she wanted it to start serious discussions, which are harder when one is protected by anonymity (it is sometimes hard to take anonymous posters seriously).  In that vain, she would like to request that any feedback be done respectively and non-anonymously.

(And FWIW, she finds writing in the third person to be very odd.)
